# Welcome to the Solitary Pig Game
In an effort to find the smartest pig, we're going to automatically play the game thousands upon thousands of times. What's the game? Glad you asked:
* Pig is given 7 turns
* What's a turn?
* To start the turn, the pig must roll the dice at least once.
* If the pig rolls a one, the turn is over.
* Any number other than 1 is added to a 'turn score'.
* The pig must then decided to roll again, or to roll the turn score into their overall score.
* If a pig rolls a 1, the turn score is not added to the overall score. The pig loses any accumulation and starts the next turn.
* The game is over once 7 turns have been completed.
